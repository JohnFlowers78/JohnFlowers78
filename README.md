- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm @JohnFlowers78
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning JavaScript and TypeScript with Web Services, ORMs and React Components.
- But I decided to stop using these languages â€‹â€‹for a while to dedicate myself and study C# + React and Kotlin because my university has subjects that require these languages:
- For the .Net and C# subject, we are developing a Minimal API using AspNetCore.Mvc, EntityFramework (ORM), DB. On the Front side, we will use (it hasn't happened yet) Node.Js with React to deal with the reuse of components such as Footer or NavBar.
- Kotlin (with fragments, Viewers and DB). ____________________
