- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JohnFlowers78
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning JavaScript and TypeScript with APIs and ORMs and React Components.
- But I decided to stop using these languages â€‹â€‹for a while to fulfill and study C# + React and
- Kotlin because my university has subjects that require these languages.
