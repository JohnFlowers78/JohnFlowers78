**👋 Hello, I'm @JohnFlowers78**
🌱 I'm currently focused on learning C# with .NET and React, as well as Kotlin for mobile development.
- I have experience in JavaScript and TypeScript, and have worked on projects involving Web Services, ORMs, and React Components.

**💻 Current Studies:**
- C# + .NET: Developing a Minimal API with ASP.NET Core MVC, Entity Framework, and a database. On the front-end, I'm using Node.js and React to implement reusable components like footers and navigation bars.
- Kotlin: Working with Fragments, Viewers, and database integration.

👀 I'm open to any kind of dev work (I don’t really like front-end, but if that’s what’s on the table, I’ll handle it 🤷‍♂️).

**🌐 About me:**
- My English is not fluent, but I can get by in almost all situations, especially with technology stuff. Coding helped me a lot because I read a lot of docs and resources in English. I really like figuring out how things work, and I enjoy learning deeply when I can. Maybe "almost all situations" it isn't with the frequency necessary that i imagine for works at developments, but i'm here to try.
